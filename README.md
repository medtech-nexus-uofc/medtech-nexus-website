This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

It is recommended to use VSCode and install the following plugins:

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss

Note: The project will use Yarn as the package manager

Running the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
